## Weather App

- Swift UI + UIKit (Storyboard)
- MVVM Design pattern
- Services / manager based architecture
- SwiftSense SPM dependency - written / published by me https://github.com/SensehacK/swift-sense
- Model data from quicktype.io
- Utilized Async - Await
- Combine based Location updates
- Info Plist - Location & http security changes
- Also commited my weather API key but I'll delete it from admin portal after it has served its purpose.

## Tools

- Postman API mocking config file

## Hurdle | Limitation

Didn't have any physical iPhone device so tested my location manager changes on the iOS simulator.
